Refine looking for labelled genes and the miniMAP analysis.  

In labelled genes:
- sort out problem with renaming group factors  
- look in genes that are ONLY in kidney  
- do the delta analysis for marker genes?  
- could try alternative marker gene strategy - proteinatlas.org (but NB human)

In miniMAP:
- choose best bowtie alignment option (? length important for the LoxP sites)
